# microbiome_analysis

Fodor Lab project reproducing and extending:

> Fouladi F, et al. **"A microbial signature following bariatric surgery is
> robustly consistent across multiple cohorts."** *Gut Microbes* / *Genome
> Medicine* (2021). Original analysis code:
> [FarnazFouladi/RYGB_IntegratedAnalysis2020](https://github.com/FarnazFouladi/RYGB_IntegratedAnalysis2020)

## Objective

1. **Reproduce** the paper's finding — that bariatric surgery (RYGB and
   related procedures) leaves a gut-microbial signature that is consistent
   across independently collected cohorts — by re-running its analysis
   pipeline from raw SRA reads through the same DADA2 / Kraken2 / cross-study
   LASSO steps the authors used, rather than from their pre-computed tables.
2. **Extend** the question beyond bariatric surgery: identify additional
   public 16S datasets from *other* GI-surgery contexts (colectomy,
   gastrectomy, ileostomy, etc.) and test whether a comparable
   surgery-associated microbial signature appears in cohorts the original
   paper never looked at — i.e. whether "gut rewiring" produces this
   signature generally, not only after bariatric procedures.

Phase 1 (reproduction, below) is complete. Phase 2 (identifying and
incorporating non-bariatric surgery cohorts) is in progress.

Not tracked in git (built locally by `scripts/00_setup.sh`, `$SW_ROOT`):

Singularity/R containers), `db/` (SILVA 132 + Kraken2 index), `singularity_cache/`.

## Workflow (phase 1 — reproduction)

The four cohorts from the original paper — **BS** (the authors' own bariatric
surgery cohort), **Assal2020**, **Afshar2018**, and **Ilhan2020** — were
processed end to end from raw SRA reads rather than starting from the
original repo's precomputed count tables:

1. **`00_setup.sh`** — one-time setup: conda env for DADA2/cutadapt, the
   authors' published Singularity containers (`rbase`, `nlme`, `r-vegan`,
   `comparestudies`, `complexheatmap`, `pathogens`, `siamcat`, `fig-perform`),
   SILVA 132 training sets, a Kraken2 index (the authors' original custom DB
   no longer exists, so a public stand-in of comparable vintage was used —
   see caveat below), and a clone of the original repo for its R modules and
   sample metadata.
2. **`01_verify.sbatch`** — confirm SRA accessions and metadata for all 4
   cohorts before committing compute to downloads.
3. **`02_download.sbatch`** — download raw forward reads per cohort (SLURM
   array, one task per cohort).
4. **`03_dada2.sbatch`** — DADA2 ASV inference per cohort (same `truncLen`
   convention as the original: 200bp for BS/Assal/Afshar, 150bp for Ilhan
   to match its shorter reads).
5. **`04_kraken2_16s.sbatch`** — Kraken2 classification of the DADA2-filtered
   reads (the same input the authors classified, not raw reads).
6. **`05_build_tables.sbatch`** — convert Kraken2/mpa reports into taxon count
   tables in the original repo's exact file layout and naming convention, so
   the unmodified downstream R modules can consume them.
7. **`06_analysis.sbatch`** — run the original repo's own R analysis modules,
   unmodified, inside the authors' published Singularity images: per-cohort
   taxa classification, combined log10/relative-abundance count tables,
   PCO, cross-study correlation and heatmap figures, diversity, and
   cross-study LASSO training with leave-one-study-out (LOSO) validation.
8. **`07_compare_auroc.sbatch`** — rebuild the LASSO AUROC matrix from our
   regenerated predictions and from the original repo's published
   predictions, and diff them directly.

## Results: ours vs. the published reproduction

**Cross-cohort genus correlation** (the paper's headline abstract number):

| | Paper (abstract) | Original repo's own re-run | Our reproduction |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mean Spearman r, different-study pairs | 0.41 ± 0.10 | 0.410 ± 0.098 (n=23) | **0.396 ± 0.097 (n=23)** |

**Cross-study LASSO AUROC matrix** (rows = training cohort, columns =
test cohort; diagonal = within-study cross-validation):

| Train \ Test | Afshar | Assal | BS | Ilhan | LOSO |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Afshar** — ours / repo | 0.701 / 0.670 | 0.825 / 0.845 | 0.986 / 0.983 | 0.718 / 0.701 | 0.823 / 0.828 |
| **Assal** — ours / repo | 0.740 / 0.698 | 0.948 / 0.948 | 0.885 / 0.901 | 0.846 / 0.735 | 0.840 / 0.836 |
| **BS** — ours / repo | 0.864 / 0.861 | 0.864 / 0.867 | 0.969 / 0.974 | 0.769 / 0.769 | 0.947 / 0.946 |
| **Ilhan** — ours / repo | 0.612 / 0.623 | 0.706 / 0.757 | 0.569 / 0.591 | 0.718 / 0.667 | 0.803 / 0.769 |

| Summary metric | Ours | Repo |
|---|---|---|
| Within-study (CV) mean AUROC | 0.834 | 0.815 |
| Study-to-study transfer mean | 0.782 | 0.778 |
| Leave-one-study-out mean | 0.853 | 0.845 |

Mean absolute difference across the full matrix: **0.022**; max difference:
**0.111** (Assal→Ilhan transfer). Differences of this size are consistent
with normal pipeline noise — DADA2 ASV-calling stochasticity and Kraken2
index drift (the authors' original custom database no longer exists; a
public index of comparable vintage was substituted, see `scripts/00_setup.sh`)
— not a breakdown of the underlying signal.

**Conclusion:** the reproduction from raw reads confirms the paper's central
claim. A consistent, transferable microbial signature of bariatric surgery
is recovered independently of the original authors' precomputed tables,
within the paper's own reported variance.

## Workflow (phase 2 — extending beyond bariatric surgery, in progress)

`scripts/09_find_datasets.sbatch` scans ENA study metadata for candidate
non-bariatric GI-surgery 16S cohorts against explicit inclusion criteria
(Illumina amplicon sequencing, ≥150bp reads, human gut samples, repeat
sampling per subject, a recoverable pre-surgical baseline plus ≥1
post-surgical timepoint, GI-surgery context), scoring and ranking results
into `dataset_scan/shortlist.tsv`. `scripts/10_inspect_candidates.sh` then
deep-inspects specific shortlisted accessions — sample label parsing,
subject/timepoint layout, read length — to decide which are actually usable
and with what DADA2 `truncLen`.

**Next step:** select 3 additional cohorts from the shortlist (e.g. covering
procedures like sleeve gastrectomy, colectomy, or ileostomy) and run them
through the same `02`–`07` pipeline to test whether the surgery-associated
microbial signature generalizes beyond bariatric surgery specifically.
